# Spacecraft Pose Estimation Based on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and on a 3D-Guided Loss Combination

Official PyTorch implementation of "Spacecraft Pose Estimation Based on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and on a 3D-Guided Loss Combination" by Juan Ignacio Bravo Pérez-Villar, Álvaro García-Martín and Jesús Bescós

## Summary
This paper presents the second ranking solution to the [Kelvins Pose Estimation 2021 Challenge] (https://kelvins.esa.int/pose-estimation-2021). The proposed solution has ranked second in both Sunlamp and Lightbox categories, with the best total average error over the two datasets. 

The main contributions of the paper are:

– A spacecraft pose estimation algorithm that incorporates 3D structure information during training, providing robustness to intensity based domain-shift.

– An unsupervised domain adaptation scheme based on robust pseudo-label generation and self-training.
