## Summary
This paper presents the second ranking solution to the [Kelvins Pose Estimation 2021 Challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/pose-estimation-2021). The proposed solution has ranked second in both Sunlamp and Lightbox categories, with the best total average error over the two datasets. 

The main contributions of the paper are:

 - A spacecraft pose estimation algorithm that incorporates 3D structure information during training, providing robustness to intensity based domain-shift.
 - An unsupervised domain adaptation scheme based on robust pseudo-label generation and self-training.

The proposed architecture with the losses incorporating the 3D information are depicted in the following figure:
